## Project Overview

My journey as a data analyst began with me asking myself which skills I needed to master so I could build a successful career. To answer the question, I developed a Python application that collects and analyzes job market data from job postings. 

Python was used to collect thousands of job postings relevant to each title.  Along with job descriptions, these posts include skills and qualifications that employers seek. Text mining, processing, and features extraction were implemented using Python NLP (Natural Language Processing) libraries. A K-means clustering algorithm applied to the job description was used to remove irrelevant job postings. A multivariable descriptive analytics technique was used to aggregate the data and produce the summary statistics, quantifying the demand for different skills in open positions related to the imputed job title. MySQL database was used for storing and managing data.
